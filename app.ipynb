    "   mkdir transcription-app\n",
    "   cd transcription-app\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   transcription-app/\n",
    "   ├── app.py\n",
    "   ├── requirements.txt\n",

    "   └── templates/\n",
    "       └── index.html\n",

    "   - Secure filename handling\n",
    "   - File size limits\n",
    "   - File type validation\n",
    "\n",
    "To customize the application, you can:\n",
    "1. Modify the upload folder location in `app.py`\n",
    "2. Adjust the maximum file size (currently 16MB)\n",
    "3. Add additional metadata fields by updating both the database model and the frontend form\n",
    "4. Customize the styling using Tailwind classes\n",
    "5. Add user authentication if needed\n",
